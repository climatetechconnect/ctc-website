			},
			{
				"title": "Favorable deal terms & control",
				"description": "Investors have different approaches to control, governance, and exit expectations. A misaligned investor might demand too much equity, aggressive growth targets, or restrictive terms, limiting your decision-making power. The right investor aligns with your long-term vision while offering fair terms."
			},
			{
				"title": "Long-term partnership",
				"description": "Investment relationships often last years, sometimes longer even than co-founder relationships. Choosing the wrong investor can lead to misaligned expectations, conflicts, or pressure for premature exits, which can derail your company's future. And waste your time."
			},
			{
				"title": "Stability & follow-on funding",
				"description": "Some investors are one-time backers, while others provide follow-on investments in later rounds. The right investor supports your company through multiple stages, reducing the pressure to constantly fundraise from scratch."
			},
			{
				"title": "Network & opportunities",
				"description": "The right investor opens doors to potential customers, partners, co-investors, and top talent. It's more than just that one person/company. An investor with no industry connections might provide money but little else, missing out on opportunities that could move you forward."
